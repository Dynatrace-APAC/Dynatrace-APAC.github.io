# Automate Feedback - Session 2
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Introduction 
Duration: 1

This lab is the second session of the AIOps Enablement Series for ANZ Bank. This track focuses on the Automate Feedback, which relates to how you could integate Dynatrace with load testing tools to create **Performance as a service**.

### What Youâ€™ll Learn 
- Creating Manual Tags in Dynatrace to define unique entity
- Load test web requests renaming
- Compare features to differentiate load test / actual requests
- Mark Load test requests as Key Requests
- Create dashboards for load-requests basic tiles
  - Response time
  - Failure rates
  - Database performance

 <!-- ------------------------ -->
 ## Useful Commands âœ… 

Positive
: To start the docker with sample application:
   `docker run -d --name SampleBankApp -p 4000:3000 nikhilgoenka/sample-bank-app`
  * This would start the docker on port localhost:4000 with docker name as **SampleBankApp**
   
**Other useful commands:**
* To **view all docker containers**: `docker ps -a`
* To **view the downloaded images** on localhost: `docker images`
* To **remove a particular image**: `docker rmi <IMAGE-NAME>`
* To **stop a docker**: `docker stop <CONTAINER-ID>`
* To **remove a docker**: `docker rm <CONTAINER-ID>`
* To **run a docker in interactive bash**: `docker run -it <CONTAINER> /bin/bash`
* To **delete all the unused images**: `docker system prune -a -f`
* To **pull a particular image**: `docker pull <docker-image>`

## Tag-based Analysis of Requests
Duration: 5

By integrating Dynatrace into your existing load testing process, you can stop broken builds in your delivery pipeline earlier.

### Defining a Unique Entity

Tagging is a powerful mechanism. However, to reap its benefits, tagging should be used carefully and in a meaningful way. To guide you towards this end, we provide you with specific recommendations and [best practices](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/tags-and-metadata/). With auto-tagging based on metadata, tags can be generated automatically and assigned to monitored entities with the specific metadata values that Dynatrace detects automatically.

Go to **Host > ec2-instance > node-bank2**

Dropdown **Properties and tags** and click on **Add tag**

Tag the service "PLACEHOLDER"

### Pushing Events to defined tag

Full integration and approach is documentated **[here]**(https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/setup-and-configuration/integrations/third-party-integrations/test-automation-frameworks/dynatrace-and-load-testing-tools-integration/)

## Renaming Load Test Requests
Duration: 20

### Naming Rules

Dynatrace automatically provides names, but they donâ€™t enable you to quickly identify where an application or service belongs to. To achieve this, it's recommended that you use service naming rules and process group naming rules. This can be done in Dynatrace using metadata imported from the monitored applications.

You can use Dynatrace Naming Rules to differentiate requests

## Analyzing Dynatrace Events 
Duration: 10

### Annotate Dynatrace with Events 

The Events API delivers details about all uncorrelated events that Dynatrace collects within your environment. Information returned for each event includes attributes about the event source, the entity where the event was collected, and other event-specific details.

PUSH endpoint enables third-party systems such as CI platforms (Jenkins, Bamboo, Electric Cloud, etc.) to provide additional details for Dynatrace automated root cause analysis.

Documentation [here](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/dynatrace-api/environment-api/events/push-deployment-events-from-jenkins/)

### Compare and Analyze events

There are different ways to analyze the data. Your approach should be based on the type of performance analysis you want to do (for example, crashes, resource and performance hotspots, or scalability issues).
